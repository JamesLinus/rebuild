# Running tests

rebuild test suite is based on cucumber/aruba:

1. Run `bundle` to install cucumber, aruba and other dependencies
2. Run `cucumber [OPTIONS]` in the source tree root:
  * `cucumber` to run all tests using binaries from the working copy
  * `cucmber -p installed` to run tests using installed binaries
  * `cucumber -t ~@slow` to exclude slow tests
