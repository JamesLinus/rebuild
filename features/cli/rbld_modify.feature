Feature: rbld modify
  As a CLI user
  I want to be able to modify existing environments with rbld modify

  Background:
    Given existing non-modified environments:
    | test-env:initial |
    | test-env:v001    |

  Scenario: modify help succeeds and usage is printed
    Given I run `rbld modify --help`
    Then it should pass with:
    """
    Modify a local environment
    """

  Scenario Outline: error code returned for non-existing environments
    When I run `rbld modify <non-existing environment name>`
    Then it should fail with:
    """
    ERROR: Unknown environment <full environment name>
    """

    Examples:
      | non-existing environment name | full environment name |
      | non-existing                  | non-existing:initial  |
      | non-existing:sometag          | non-existing:sometag  |

  Scenario Outline: non-interactive modification of environment
    When I successfully run `rbld modify <environment name> -- echo Hello world!`
    Then it should pass with:
      """
      >>> rebuild env <environment host name>-M
      >>> echo Hello world!
      Hello world!
      <<< rebuild env <environment host name>-M
      """
    And environment <environment name> should be marked as modified

    Examples:
      | environment name | environment host name |
      | test-env:v001    | test-env-v001         |
      | test-env         | test-env-initial      |

  Scenario Outline: interactive modification of environment
    When I run `rbld modify <environment name>` interactively
    And I type "echo Hello interactive world!"
    And I close the stdin stream
    Then it should pass with:
      """
      >>> rebuild env <environment host name>-M interactive
      >>> Press CTRL-D do leave
      Hello interactive world!
      <<< rebuild env <environment host name>-M
      """
    And environment <environment name> should be marked as modified

    Examples:
      | environment name | environment host name |
      | test-env:v001    | test-env-v001         |
      | test-env         | test-env-initial      |

  Scenario: hostname of environment set to the environment name with modified sign
    When I run `rbld modify test-env:v001 -- hostname`
    Then it should pass with:
      """
      >>> rebuild env test-env-v001-M
      >>> hostname
      test-env-v001-M
      <<< rebuild env test-env-v001-M
      """

  Scenario Outline: rbld modify propagates exit code
    When I run `rbld modify test-env:v001 -- exit <internal status>`
    Then the exit status should be <external status>

    Examples:
      | internal status | external status |
      |  0              | 0               |
      |  5              | 5               |
